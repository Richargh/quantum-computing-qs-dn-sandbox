= Qsharp

== Usage

* Install link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/install-command-line-qdk[.NET Core 3.1, VS Code and QDK for VS Code].
** link:https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download[.NET Core 3.1]
** link:https://code.visualstudio.com/download[VS Code]
** link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.quantum-devkit-vscode[Microsoft Quantum Development Kit for Visual Studio Code]. Instead of using the link you can open VS Code -> Extensions Button on the left side -> Search for Q# or Qsharp -> Install the SDK from "Microsoft DevLabs"
* Open the terminal and navigate to the `Qsharp.csproj`
* `dotnet build` and wait for projects to be downloaded. This took a long time the first time (quite a few minutes).
* `dotnet run` to see the result

== Gates

* X-Gate (not): +
  Inverts the bit
* H(adamard)-Gate: +
  Maps very nicely into an equal superposition and back again.
* CNOT-Gate: +
  C(ontrol)-Gate, our if. If the first of two bits is zero, then don't flip the second. If the first bit is one, then flip the second.
